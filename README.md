# SystemVerilog Practice

SystemVerilog is a hardware description and verification language used primarily in the design and verification of digital systems. It's an extension of the Verilog hardware description language (HDL), enhancing it with features for design, verification, and testbench development. SystemVerilog includes constructs for specifying complex designs, describing behavior, and verifying the correctness of digital circuits. It's widely used in the semiconductor industry for its ability to handle both design and verification aspects of digital systems.

## Pre-Requisites

- Visual Studio Code Integrated Development Environment
- Xilinx Vivado Design Suite

## Implementation and Execution

### Source File Creation

Start by creating a SystemVerilog source file and writing the code according to the design requirements. This file describes the digital system's behavior and structure.

### Testbench Development

Create a testbench for the designed file. Write code within the testbench to verify and validate the behavior of signals and modules declared in the source file. This testbench simulates the functionality of the designed system.

### Waveforms Generation

Run the simulation that process the simulated behavior of signals during the design and testbench execution. The waveforms can be visualized using the in-built waveform viewer to analyze and understand the behavior of signals over time.
